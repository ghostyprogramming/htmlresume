                    Hello, my name is Kevin Paz and I am a Senior here at George Mason. I am majoring in Information Technology with a concentration in 
                    Web Development. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Web Design and Web Development are one of my favorite things to learn and experiment with because it gives me a wide range of tools that I can use to express
                    my creativity and ideas. I am a big fan of design languages and themes such as Skeuomorphism, Y2K, Frutiger Aero, and Metro design. In fact, I based the design
                    for this website on Windows 2000 which I like due to it's simplicity and recognition. I have made other concept designs that I will link below if you would like
                    to see them! 
                </p>
				<p>
					Some of the key skills that I gained through work experiences include:
					<ul class="ul-adjust">
						<li>Being self-sufficient while still working as a team with other members</li>
						<li>Providing great customer service to all types of customers</li>
						<li>Be a team player and encouraging collaboration in the workplace</li>
						<li>Working under heavy pressure</li>
					</ul>
					I also have knowledge in some areas including:
					<ul class="ul-adjust">
						<li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
						<li>Python</li>
						<li>Computer Hardware</li>
						<li>Web Design</li>
						<li>Cyber Security</li>
						<li>Database Management</li>
						<li>MacOS / Linux OS</li>
					</ul>
