					One of my goals for this year is to be able to market myself better to employers and improve my skillset. 
                </p>
                <p>
					I aim to start taking certification exams and to see if I can challenge myself with a project that can help demonstate my abilities really well.
					As I take more exams and grow as an IT hobbiest, I will update this page as I go along. Check back for more information!
